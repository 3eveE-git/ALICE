# ALICE
ALICE- Analytical Language Interpretation and Classification Environment

This is project created in collaboration with the IDeaS Center CMU, under the guidance of Dr. Kathleen Carly. Contributors include Prakhar Agrawal, Alice Xinran Ma and Lily Junyi Guo.

Creating an ML system that encapsulates NLP models and existing APIs to assess the accuracy parameters of statements input by the user along with a source tracking mechanism that would provide reliability scores for individual/agencies. A large chunk of the training data has been pulled from Twitter. And so an alternate name for the project is Tweet-o-Meter.
